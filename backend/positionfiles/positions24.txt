Title: Workshop Leader
Description: Would you like to lead workshops and meet interesting people from all over the world? If so, you should apply for the position of Workshop Leader! 


What do you think will happen when you gather 20 students to discuss topics like education, revolutions, misinformation, or religion? The goal of the workshops are to break down prejudices and to find common ground among people from all over the world. The Workshop Leaders are in charge of planning, facilitating discussions, and leading activities. Through this, you will get to know other people's viewpoints and build bridges between different cultures. This is a unique position as it is one of the only jobs in ISFiT where you get to meet and form strong friendships with the participants. Moreover, the Workshop Team is the largest team in ISFiT and is a perfect way to meet new like-minded students from Trondheim. 


There are no requirements to becoming a Workshop Leader other than willingness to develop your leadership and public speaking skills, organisation, and enthusiasm towards topics related to “Creating Knowledge”. 


Feel free to send us an email or a message on Facebook if you have any questions. We are looking forward to hearing from you!
