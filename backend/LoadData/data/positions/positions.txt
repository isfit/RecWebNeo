Title: External Coordinator
Section: Culture
Team: Project Day
Description: Become part of ISFiT as a Project Day Team member where problem-solving and creativity in an international environment are key factors. We in the Project Day Team need another team member! As part of Project Day, you will be joining our team brainstorms on how to organize, angle, and plan all our events. Your specific area of focus will be on taking charge of our incoming panellists and artists as our External Coordinator. But as we are a smaller team, we hope that you can help come up with ideas and support the other aspects of Project Day as well. Project Day is a two-day event that takes place during the main festival, a sort of ‘festival within the festival’. The focus of Project Day this time around is how accessibility, multidisciplinarity, and interculturalism affect the overarching theme for the entire festival; the creation of knowledge. Among other events, Project Day includes a concert and a panel, and it is these participants that will become your main responsibility. These events will be taking place during the first part of Project Day at Samfundet. Therefore, you will be working the closest with the Project Day Coordinator active that day when working on the plan/stay/journey for incoming guests. Being good at communicating professionally whilst also staying organized and maintaining a clear overview of situations are good traits to have as an External Coordinator. No specific experience is needed - all that’s required is a mindset and attitude that will help the team in both the creative planning and smooth execution of Project Day. Please contact one of our Project Day Coordinators, Oda Agdal, by email or phone for any questions you might have regarding the position. Hope to hear from you!
