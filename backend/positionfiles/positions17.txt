Project Day is an event for the volunteers and participants of ISFiT21 devoted to the different ways in which we create knowledge using different arts and cultural approaches. The Project Coordinator will be in charge of brainstorming, planning, and creating Project Day. A Project Coordinator will work closely with the rest of the Project Day Team and the Culture Section to create an event that is original and inclusive.

Everyone should be able to gain a new understanding of the Creating Knowledge edition of ISFiT and take an active part in the event. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
