Title: Project Coordinator
Description: Would you like to be a part of a team creating exciting campaigns, see your own ideas put into reality, and explore your creative sides? Then a Project Coordinator in Campaign is the position for you! 
 
As a Project Coordinator in Campaign you will be part of an amazing team organizing campaigns from start to finish, all the while forging new friendships and experiencing memorable events. Two of our campaigns are the Coffee Campaign and the Torchlight Procession called the Walk of Peace. These are organized and carried out every ISFiT, however, we will organize plenty of other campaigns and projects as well. Do you want to plan exhibitions at the biggest universities in Norway, help brew a peace beer, or produce commercials? The possibilities are endless, only limited to your imagination! The campaigns will be both on a local and national scale, and you will get a chance to make your own thoughts and ideas into actual events! 


No former experience is required for this position, only the will and motivation to do a great job for ISFiT21 and the Student Peace Prize. If you are eager, or maybe undecided, feel free to send me a message or contact me in person to have a chat.  


Peaceful greetings,
