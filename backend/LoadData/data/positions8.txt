Title: Economic Manager
Description: Do you want to know how the economy in a large student organization works?  Do you like crunching numbers? And are you a problem solver? If any of these questions fit you or sound interesting, then apply for the Economic Management Team in ISFiT21!


The Economic Management Team in ISFiT is responsible for keeping track of the big economic picture of the festival. As an Economic Manager you will help manage the finances of the largest international student festival in the world. You will learn practical accounting skills and procedures while you join in shaping the festival. No prior experience is needed, all you need is motivation.
